                        Currently, my favorite CMSC subject is CMSC 22: Object Oriented Programming. This is because I enjoyed learning the basic concepts and principles of OOP which are essential to software development. Understanding the pillars of OOP as well as how they work together was a long but fun process. More importantly, I had fun incorporating those essentials in creating mini game applications with user interface and animations through the platform Java FX. Creating my own simple mini game application using the knowledge I learned in this course was a fun and fulfilling experience.

                    <p class="bl-1">
                        ARTS 1: Critical Perspectives in the Arts, which I took when I was still in my 1st year, is my favorite GE course. At first, I thought that the course would just require us to submit artworks and essays on how we see a certain art however, that is not the case. The course piqued my interest as it discussed how relevant the arts is in the society. I liked how it doesn't just revolve on the aesthetics of art but also on the discursive nature of art.

                    <p class="bl-1">
                        Since I really enjoyed the course CMSC 22, I also came to like Java. From my experience, learning Java was easier compared to the other programming languages I learned. I also like how using classes, objects, inheritance, and other concepts of OOP makes programming much more relatable. Apart from that, Java has an API that includes classes, interfaces, and packages that are free to use which makes programming more efficient.

                    <p class="bl-2">
                        I have a lot on my list of favorite foods. Ever since I was a kid, I loved eating sweet foods like ice cream, chocolate, and cake. Apart from that, I also love eating adobo, caldereta, and sarciado paired with rice.
